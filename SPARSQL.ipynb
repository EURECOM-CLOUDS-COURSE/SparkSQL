    "# 2. Analysis of flight data using the DataFrame API and SparkSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we play the role of a data scientist working in the travel industry, specifically on air transportation of passengers. We want to explore the data collected by the Department of Transportation (DoT) to understand passengers' behavior, as well as the properties of all flights, across several airline companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided by the DoT has 29 features, that can be either categorical or numerical. For example, the ```src_airport``` (source airport) is categorical: there exist no comparison operator between airport names. We can not say \"SGN is bigger than NCE\". The ```departure_time``` feature is numerical, for which a comparison operator exists. For instance, \"flight departing before 6PM\" can be express by \"departure_time < 1800\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, most features are numerical, except carrier, flight_number, cancelled, cancelation_code and diverted. \n",
    "The data contains a header, that is useless when analyzing the data: it serves the purpose of an \"embedded schema\", to help data scientist figure out what information is available. Note that there are some features with missing values in some lines of the dataset. The missing values are marked by \"NA\". These values can cause problems when processing the data and can lead to unexpected results. Therefore, we need to remove the header and replace all \"NA\" values by empty values, such as they can be interpreted as null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DataFrame\n",
    "As we have seen already, there are multiple ways to manipulate data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the RDD abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the DataFrame abstraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is based on the data frame concept in R language or in Pandas for Python. In some sense, it is similar to a table in a relational database: each item is a list of values (the columns). Also, the value in each row of each column can be accessed by the column's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use DataFrames, the data should be clean (no invalid values). That means we cannot create DataFrame directly from the \"RAW\" data. Instead, we will first create an RDD from RAW data, produce a new, clean RDD, then transform it to a DataFrame and work on it. The RDD `cleaned_data` is an RDD[String]. We need to transform it to RDD[(TypeOfColumn1, TypeOfColumn2, ..., TypeOfColumn29)] then call a function to create a DataFrame from the new RDD. Please note that, package com.databricks.spark.csv can really help us to load the data efficiently without concerns about parsing, conversions, etc... However, the CSV package can have some problems when loading not well-formatted data or the data that has many kinds of missing values. The guidelines defined this notebook are a general way to help you work with any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the labs in this course, we will mainly work with CSV data files. So, in the next sections, we only focus on constructing dataframes from structured data files directly and from existing RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing a DataFrame directly from structured data file\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct DataFrame from a structured file directly, the file type must be supported. Currently, Spark supports csv, json, avro and many more. Among these types, the csv type is one of the most popular in data analytics. A DataFrame is constructed from csv files by using the package spark-csv from Databricks.\n"
